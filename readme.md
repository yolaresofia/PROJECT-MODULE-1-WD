GREETING CARDS ARE UNDERRATED

## Description
GREETING CARDS ARE UNDERRATED is a responsive and interactive web page. It might seem, at first, that you're going to obtain an inspirational quote card, but really you'll be receiving a random "Fuck you" "greeting card" with different designs containing names of a sender and receiver of said card. It also contains an interactive game that displays random "Fuck you" phrases. Info obtained from https://www.foaas.com

## MVP
Responsive webpage (mobile-first, tablet, laptop)
Display a greeting card in a random way (user-friendly).
To have at least a landing-page, sign-up form and log-in form.
Sign up-form and log-in form must have some validation format (i.e. password must be longer than 6 characters).
The user data should be stored in local storage.

## User Story
A way for users to tell somebody to fuck-off, in a "nicer" way.
Interact with the website.

## Backlog
A wildframe were the cards obtained are displayed.
Landing-page should be bright colored until the first card is randomized, when at that point the whole landing-page will change to black and red.
An invisible nav bar (containing log-in, game and cards history) and animations will be available.
Data structure
Users data will be obtained from the sign up form and stored in local storage. The log in form will look for information in the local storage which should match with the info that the user provided in the log in form to successfully log in. The log-in mission will be to send a weekly "Fuck you" card.
Go back to 'cute' mode.
